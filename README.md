Created a local repo which then got pushed to our personal github repository.
We then gave access to the repo to our partner.
By accessing their remote repo and creating a new branch, we modified their original expecations.txt file.
We then pushed the local edited version to the remote repository and create a pull request via github.
We then approved of each other's merge request and combined the new branches with the main branches.
